 ARS_ministry_of_the_state_desc:0 "After our victory in the Six-Year War against Kolechia we must reconsider the future of our great country. Greatness lies before us, here at home and far away.

 ARS_ministry_of_labor:0 "Ministry of Labor"

 ARS_intimidate_the_neighbours_desc:0 "Now that the Kolechian issue has been resolved, we can turn our gaze further westward. The weaker states of Impor and Republia cannot defy our might, and our powerful fascist brothers in Antegria might just agree to annexation. If not, they too will bend."

 ARS_incite_the_kolechians_desc:0 "The Six-Year War was an Arstotzkan victory stopped only by exhaustion. Further revenge has been on the minds of our military ever since, and now is the time to use the power of the state to achieve this.

 ARS_cobrastan_resolved:0 "Cobrastan Resolved"
 ARS_cobrastan_resolved_desc:0 "The Cobrastani people are brave and resilient, especially in the face of Kolechian and Russian oppression.

 ARS_cobrastan_ignored:0 "Cobrastan Ignored"
 ARS_cobrastan_ignored_desc:0 "The Cobrastani are a proud people, but their ambitions for independence are but a dream. They could never achieve on their own what we already have in such a short time. Their people will be part of us as we grow into a greater and more prosperous Arstotzka."
 ARS_cobrastani_exploitation:0 "Cobrastani Exploitation"
 ARS_cobrastani_exploitation_desc:0 "Despite their protests and beliefs to the contrary, the occupation of the Cobrastani homeland continues apace. There is much development underway there, providing the state with more essential manufacturing, and jobs to the disenchanted Cobrastani."

 ARS_develop_the_north:0 "Develop the North"
 ARS_develop_the_north_desc:0 "The northern regions of our nation are the bread-basket of this land. Without their tireless work our people would surely suffer starvation worse than in the Great War. Good roads and rail links will bring their labours to us all."
 ARS_obristan_occupied:0 "Obristan Occupied"
 ARS_obristan_occupied_desc:0 "Of all the lands surrounding ours, Obristan was the one our people was fond of the most. Even the most patriotic in our military and government had some reservations about outright war. But that is immaterial now, we must make the best of it."
 ARS_united_federation_occupied:0 "United Federation Occupied"
 ARS_united_federation_occupied_desc:0 "There are some places where democracy works and some where it doesn't. The United Federation is worse than both. They use their democracy like the Russians would use a tank, crushing all before it. We do not pity them."
 ARS_kolechian_consolidation:0 "Kolechian Consolidation"
 ARS_kolechian_consolidation_desc:0 "With our Kolechian problem dealt with, we can begin taking advantage of the potential their land has. Roads and railways damaged by the wars must be our first priority."
 ARS_kolechian_exploitation:0 "Kolechian Exploitation"
 ARS_kolechian_exploitation_desc:0 "Kolechia never fully took advantage of what their country has to offer. Instead, our great state will see to it that no resource is left untapped."

 ARS_develop_the_imrean_region_desc:0 "The three smallest of our neighbours have never been in the position to fund their own defence, let alone heavy industries. Now is a golden opportunity for us."
 ARS_develop_the_nothern_plains:0 "Develop the Northern Plains"
 ARS_develop_the_nothern_plains_desc:0 "Obristan may have been an element of stability in this region, but their land was always more valuable than something just to block us in."
 ARS_develop_the_western_plains:0 "Develop the Western Plains"
 ARS_develop_the_western_plains_desc:0 "The United Federation thought of itself as the eastern-most spot of freedom in the world. Despite their liberty, they were unable to make the most of their economy. This changes now."
 ARS_imrean_volunteers:0 "Imrean Volunteers"
 ARS_imrean_volunteers_desc:0 "With the Imrean region now a part of our great nation, many of their locals find themselves drawn to their new flag with great loyalty and devotion."
 ARS_obristan_volunteers:0 "Obristan Volunteers"
 ARS_obristan_volunteers_desc:0 "Obristan has always been a neutral mediator or a place of stability, but their people have long-held traditions of discipline and military service. We can tap into this reserve without much resistance."
 ARS_united_federation_volunteers:0 "United Federation Volunteers"
 ARS_united_federation_volunteers_desc:0 "Far to the west of here is the United Federation. Long before they embraced democracy they were a people known for fierce mercenary forces. It is time to rekindle these memories."

 ARS_glory_to_arstotzka_desc:0 "The legions of this glorious land have proven themselves as among the best in the world. The stain on our honor and glory that was the Kolechian menace is gone forever. Today we stand proud in the world."
 ARS_arstotzkan_valor:0 "Glorious Arstotzkan Valor"
 ARS_arstotzkan_valor_desc:0 "Greater Arstotzka has risen to the pinnicle of world power, yet we find ourselves challenged like never before. Our patriotism is required now more than ever to ensure our success. Even if it means a great sacrifice."
 ARS_propaganda_ministry:0 "Propaganda Politics"
 ARS_propaganda_ministry_desc:0 "The Truth of Arstotzka already does a fine job of telling people what they need to hear. Now we will take this a step further and begin spreading the correct information through more subtle methods."
 ARS_demand_the_baltic_states:0 "Demand the Baltic States"
 ARS_demand_the_baltic_states_desc:0 "The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia are far too small to defend themselves alone, or together. Besides, they're too small for the Germans or Russians to miss them."
 ARS_from_one_monarch_to_another:0 "From one Monarch to Another"
 ARS_from_one_monarch_to_another_desc:0 "Every kingdom has its price and Obristan is no different. We can begin our march to the arctic if they ceed their eastern half to us. Their compensation will be considerable, if they agree."
 ARS_to_the_north:0 "To The North!"
 ARS_to_the_north_desc:0 "In times gone past, long before the Russians or Scandinavians claimed the area, kingdoms of this land held the northernmost shores of this continent. So it will be again."

 ARS_kolechian_reproachment_desc:0 "The Six-Year War hurt the Kolechian spirit quite badly, and relations have never been worse than after the fiasco with their top diplomat's visit. We must begin the long process of making ammends for our past and reach out to them."
 ARS_state_run_education:0 "State Run Education"
 ARS_state_run_education_desc:0 "The Arstotzkan people are filled with great potential, but lacking in the education that is needed for victory. Therefore, the great Arstotzkan state will ensure all people are educated to the limits of their ability and desire. With their minds malleable at this formative stage, we can also instill patriotism within them."
 ARS_state_sponsored_engineers:0 "State Sponsored Engineers"

 ARS_nirsk_petrochemical:0 "Nirsk Petrochemical"
 ARS_nirsk_petrochemical_desc:0 "One of the more significant reasons for our agreement to an early end to the Six-Year War was our lack of fuel. Nirsk was hit hard by the Kolechians during the war, making it ideal for expansion."
 ARS_first_three_years_plan:0 "First Three Year Plan"
 ARS_first_three_years_plan_desc:0 "The Six-Year War damaged much of the Arstotzkan economy and interrupted our plans for the complete modernization of our nation's industry. The concept of the Three-Year Plan has been developed to get us back on our feet."

 ARS_self_sufficient_motherland_desc:0 "Arstotzka will accept nothing less than the utter economic and industrial dominance of the region. This lofty goal is at our fingertips as we speak. Let us make it reality."
 ARS_the_truth_of_arstotzka:0 "The Truth of Arstotzka"
 ARS_the_truth_of_arstotzka_desc:0 "The Truth of Arstotzka is our nation's most trusted source of news for the people. It has consistently provided the masses with government approved messages ever since our independence. It can be a tool to both inform, and manipulate."
 ARS_cobrastan_coerced:0 "Cobrastan Coerced"
 ARS_cobrastan_coerced_desc:0 "Our Cobrastani client state to the south is short of useful citizens to fill the ranks of their military and their factories. We can use our authority over them to resolve our current refugee and immigration problems. However, it may ruin their economy."
 ARS_kolechian_demilitarization:0 "Kolechian Demilitarization"
 ARS_kolechian_demilitarization_desc:0 "Now that we have conquered and broken the Kolechian scourge once and for all, we must take steps to keep them from ever threatening us again. Banning them from service in the military and police is a start, but is only the beginning..."
 ARS_deploy_police_commandos:0 "Deploy Police Commandos"
 ARS_deploy_police_commandos_desc:0 "Kolechians cannot be trusted, everyone knows this. But their latest acts of terrorism and treason are disgusting even by their standards. Thankfully, our loyal Police Commandos stand ready to crush these dissidents."
 ARS_kolechian_partition:0 "Kolechian Partition"
 ARS_kolechian_partition_desc:0 "Experience has taught us that the best way to control people is to make them wholeheartedly believe a lie. Make them believe they actually control their destiny. Thus, we will split Kolechia into two client states we can easily regulate."
 ARS_kolechian_guidance:0 "Kolechian Guidance"
 ARS_kolechian_guidance_desc:0 "Knowing what we know of the World War that scarred the globe, trampling someone's national pride and forcing guilt on them won't build a stable nation. Kolechia was our enemy. Now, they will become our friend. The healing begins now."
 ARS_kolechia_occupied:0 "Kolechia Occupied"
 ARS_kolechia_occupied_desc:0 "Kolechians cannot be trusted, even if they are sincerely and convincingly lied to by their own leaders. The only way to get anything out of them is to force them to. Those that resist the most will learn the hardest."

 ARS_siberian_proposal:0 "Siberian Proposal"
 ARS_siberian_proposal_desc:0 "The vast wastelands of the Siberian region of the Soviet Union is almost completely unpopulated, undeveloped, unexplored, and ignored.

 ARS_arstotzkan_siberia:0 "Arstotzkan Siberia"
 ARS_arstotzkan_siberia_desc:0 "The Soviet Union has given us full control over Siberia and more than the balance of what it can provide. The development of it, and the removal of our criminal element begins now."

 ARS_great_steppe_auxiliary_desc:0 "There are vast tracts of land in the Soviet Union which although aren't as remote as Siberia, they still manage to avoid most attention from Stalingrad. We prepared a plan during the Russian Civil War that was never given serious thought. Until now."

 ARS_sieze_the_great_steppe_desc:0 "With Turkistan now fully developed and the Soviets soft underbelly increasingly vulnerable and rebellious, we will put the final phase of our plan into action and amputate it for ourselves.

 ARS_arstotzkan_red_army_desc:0 "Even though our Soviet advisors have given us invaluable knowledge in reconditioning our army, what works for the Soviet Union doesn't work for us. The Arstotzkan Army will be of our own design, even if inspired by others."
 ARS_mandatory_military_academies:0 "Mandatory Military Academies"
 ARS_mandatory_military_academies_desc:0 "Arstotzkans of all ages can serve our armed forces in some way or another, even if it is a non-combatant role. Making military and paramilitary training mandatory will cement the hearts and minds of the people to serve, but at a cost."
 ARS_ministry_of_the_army:0 "Ministry of the Army"
 ARS_ministry_of_the_army_desc:0 "The Arstotzkan Army emerged from the Six-Year War battered and depleted but with a sense of purpose. The only things they lack are available funds and resources. The Kolechians will come for us again, that much is not in doubt. We must be ready."

 ARS_overseas_military_observers_desc:0 "Although the international community considers them to be political and social pariahs for their expansionism, that doesn't mean they aren't sources of invaluable warfighting knowledge.

 ARS_command_staff_summit_desc:0 "Of all the things our country and military are lacking, quality commanding and staff officers are not among them. Our general staff and admiralty learned fast and adapted during the war, which was one of the main factors leading to our victory. It would benefit all involved if we formed a Combined Command Staff to coordinate all military activity more closely."

 ARS_ministry_of_the_air_force_desc:0 "It is no secret that the Arstotzkan Air Force did very little during the war. Mostly because it was little more than token volunteer scouting and spotting planes. The world is moving on though, and we have already been left far behind."

 ARS_airborne_equality:0 "Airborne Equality"
 ARS_airborne_equality_desc:0 "Defending this great land from the air means defending all of our people from both fear, and from danger. It would be hypocritical of us to not allow brave and talented Arstotzkan women to take to the skies in our name."
 ARS_ministry_of_the_navy:0 "Ministry of the Navy"
 ARS_ministry_of_the_navy_desc:0 "Much like the Air Force, the Arstotzkan Navy has been short-changed and neglected to maximize the development and maintenance of the Army. With Kolechia forming a provisional volunteer navy, we can't afford to ignore this new emerging threat."
 ARS_menace_from_the_sea:0 "Menace from the Sea"
 ARS_menace_from_the_sea_desc:0 "Fishermen from coastal towns have been seeing Kolechian gunboats in the Black Sea for some time now, although none have harassed our shipping. The Ministry of Propaganda won't be able to cover this up, instead we will use it to our advantage."
 ARS_naval_expansion_directive:0 "Naval Expansion Directive"
 ARS_naval_expansion_directive_desc:0 "There is much we can do to build a modern navy, despite our short and undeveloped coastline. The Ministry of Labor may be able to reallocate funds for additional naval infrastructure."
 ARS_glorious_sailors:0 "Glorious Sailors"
 ARS_glorious_sailors_desc:0 "Our naval observers have been making careful notes about the more powerful navies of the world. Their efforts have not been in vain, for they have learned much about how we can improve."
 ARS_arstotzkan_doctrine:0 "Arstotzka's Doctrine"
 ARS_arstotzkan_doctrine_desc:0 "Arstotzka defends its people from all theats and foes. On the land, on the sea, and in the air. All three of these will benefit equally from the chaos that is the current world situation."
 ARS_coastal_patrol_expanded:0 "Coastal Patrol Expanded"
 ARS_coastal_patrol_expanded_desc:0 "Now that the Navy has been pushing their agenda lately, various design companies have approached us with differing designs and proposals for a limited Black Sea fleet."
 ARS_beyond_gunboats:0 "Beyond Gunboats"
 ARS_beyond_gunboats_desc:0 "An Arstotzkan Blue Water Navy has never been in our minds or even our dreams, but that is about to change. Regardless of what side of the coming war we find ourselves on, having no navy at all will leave us at the mercy of those around us."
 ARS_glory_on_the_seas:0 "Glory On The Seas"
 ARS_glory_on_the_seas_desc:0 "Further expansion of our navy may have been a poor financial choice a few short years ago, but it is now essential to our survival."
 ARS_skywall_program:0 "Skywall Program"
 ARS_skywall_program_desc:0 "The Ministry of Admission is doing us a huge service by protecting our border from the Kolechian plague. Now the Air Force wants something just as good to protect us from any potential Kolechian paratroopers and marauding planes."
 ARS_seawall_program:0 "Seawall Program"
 ARS_seawall_program_desc:0 "With both the Ministry of the Army and the Ministry of the Air Force getting fortifications, the Ministry of the Navy won't be left out of the proceedings. Our coastline may be short and easy to cover, but the Kolechians are sneaky and opportunistic."
 ARS_ministry_of_admission:0 "Ministry of Admission"
 ARS_ministry_of_admission_desc:0 "Perhaps the most important role for any of our ministries is the control and regulation of immigrants entering this great country. Whether they are Arstotzkan citizens or not, whether they have valid reasons and papers for being here or not, we must protect our people from foreign threats entering our country."
 ARS_arstotzkan_soviet_agreement:0 "Arstotzkan-Soviet Argreement"
 ARS_arstotzkan_soviet_agreement_desc:0 "Both Arstotzka and the Soviet Union are hosts to each other's natives. Even though our relations with our Soviet brothers and sisters is continually strained, we can help each other by entering into a mutual immigration partnership."
 ARS_purged_soviet_officers:0 "Purged Soviet Officers"
 ARS_purged_soviet_officers_desc:0 "Joseph Stalin has recently completed a purge of his officer corps and general staff, leading to horrendous damage to their ability to wage war. We have a few STAVKA contacts in Stalingrad that know some of the purged officers. Depending on how we handle this, we could smuggle them out and give them exile here. The consequences of this, could be severe..."
 ARS_unthinkable_betrayal:0 "Unthinkable Betrayal"
 ARS_unthinkable_betrayal_desc:0 "Leon Trotsky has recently been assassinated in Mexico. We have reason to believe Stalin himself gave the order, but no proof of this. We're sending our best Ministry of Intelligence officers to Mexico to investigate the situation."
 ARS_broken_glory:0 "Broken Glory"
 ARS_broken_glory_desc:0 "Victory in the Six-Year War was for the pride of the nation, but we left the job undone. West Grestin still lays beyond our borders, Arstotzkan citizens are scattered across the plains, and Kolechia still exists. Regaining our glory must be our highest priority."
 ARS_foreign_workers_admitted:0 "Foreign Workers Admitted"
 ARS_foreign_workers_admitted_desc:0 "The Ministry of Admission has initiated an immigrant labor program for limited numbers of qualified and properly documented foreign nationals. Security will have to be tighened to ensure a smooth improvement to our labor force."
 ARS_foreign_workers_interned:0 "Foreign Workers Interned"
 ARS_foreign_workers_interned_desc:0 "The migrant labor situation has deterioated as an increasing number of criminals and even terrorists are finding their way across our borders. Effective immediately all foreign workers found working in Arstotzka will be placed into state detention until further notice."
 ARS_foreign_workers_conscripted:0 "Foreign Workers Conscripted"
 ARS_foreign_workers_conscripted_desc:0 "The Ministry of Information has thoroughly investigated the bulk of interned foreign workers and determined the threat to our country to be somewhat severe. Combined with targeted arrests and continuous surveillance, the bulk of the troublemakers will be conscripted into military work battalions. There, the Police Commandos will keep a close watch on them."
 ARS_foreign_workers_partitioned:0 "Foreign Workers Relocated"
 ARS_foreign_workers_partitioned_desc:0 "The Ministry of Labor has received a detailed report indicating that the foreign workers currently interned are of minimal threat to our country if they are correctly contained in secured working areas. Thus, we will begin construction on new industrial cities to safely monitor them and maximize their efforts for benefit the state."
 ARS_foreign_workers_unionized:0 "Foreign Workers Unionized"
 ARS_foreign_workers_unionized_desc:0 "The Ministry of Justice has recently ruled in favor of the migrant laborers currently in state detention. Their ruling states that they should be allowed to form their own Foreign Labor Union to ensure their rights and freedoms are respected. Whether the people of Arstotzka particularly like this ruling or not is another matter."
 ARS_supreme_glory:0 "Supreme Glory"
 ARS_supreme_glory_desc:0 "Our Glory and Honor are both undeniable. How can anyone say we have not proven ourselves worthy of the highest standing of national pride in the world? If any stand against us, all shall fall before us. Glory to Arstotzka!"
 ARS_greater_arstotzka:0 "Greater Arstotzka"
 ARS_greater_arstotzka_desc:0 "The concept of Greater Arstotzka is as old as the land we call home. It has come in many guises in the past and under many rulers. How we treat the people in the conquered lands abroad is as important as the conquests themselves."
 ARS_social_integration:0 "Social Integration"
 ARS_social_integration_desc:0 "Above and beyond what we have already accomplished is what is yet to come. Arstotzkans are different from Russians and Ukrainians. Obristani are different from Finns and the Baltic peoples. Realizing this and coming to an acceptable compromise is what makes strong nations unbeatable."
 ARS_national_industrialization_initiative:0 "National Industrialization Initiative"
 ARS_national_industrialization_initiative_desc:0 "With our immediate future if not perfectly clear at least predictable, it would seem to be a waste to leave education, research, and the industrial sectors managed separately from each other."
 ARS_nationalized_research_teams:0 "Nationalized Research Teams"
 ARS_nationalized_research_teams_desc:0 "With even more of our discoveries having a direct impact on the lives of our people and the success of our country, directing further funding to R&D is vital to the survival of the state."
 ARS_secrets_from_darkness:0 "Secrets from Darkness"
 ARS_secrets_from_darkness_desc:0 "There are those among our population who flee from the Soviet Union simply to avoid the attention of the NKVD. Even some of our own senior intelligence personnel were once Cheka agents in the early days of the Bolsheviks. With all of that in mind, there is much we can learn by studying their techniques."
 ARS_intelligence_officer_integration:0 "Intelligence Officer Integration"
 ARS_intelligence_officer_integration_desc:0 "With our country open to foreign intrusion and corruption from within and without, directly placing intelligence operatives into frontline military units is now essential and unavoidable. Not only will they observe our own troops, but can utilize their network of contacts abroad for use prior to important battles."
 ARS_revolution_of_hearts_and_minds:0 "Revolution of Hearts and Minds"
 ARS_revolution_of_hearts_and_minds_desc:0 "Striking a balance between the feelings of the heart and the thoughts of the mind has never been easy. Luckily, we have The Truth of Arstotzka, the best and most glorious source of news in the world."
 ARS_totality_of_foreign_conscription:0 "Totality of Foreign Conscription"
 ARS_totality_of_foreign_conscription_desc:0 "The war has taken its toll on us, and even more so on our enemies. Escalating our war efforts at this point may not be popular, but the victory we gain after the fact will make everyone appreciate the sacrifice."
 ARS_district_development_plan:0 "District Development Plan"
 ARS_district_development_plan_desc:0 "The eight districts of Arstotzka have been heavily built-up over the last few years, but much of our lands are rural and unused. The Soviets have plans for new industrial cities we could learn from."
 ARS_patriotic_nationalization:0 "Patriotic Nationalization"
 ARS_patriotic_nationalization_desc:0 "The Ministries of Labor, Propaganda, and Information have decided it is time to once again call upon the patriotic masses of this glorious land to sacrifice for the greater good. Doing so can only make us stronger in these troubled times."
 ARS_frontline_espionage:0 "Frontline Espionage"
 ARS_frontline_espionage_desc:0 "The current state of warfare leaves the lines between military reconnaissance and espionage blurred or completely erased. Combat Intelligence Operatives will be trained to utilize their covert intelligence skills to directly affect warfare at even the lowest levels."
 ARS_frontline_military_police:0 "Police Commandos"
 ARS_frontline_military_police_desc:0 "The Ministry of Information and the Arstotzkan Army both agree that our frontline combat capability can be enhanced by combining the political and counter-terrorist role of our State Police with frontline special forces units."
 ARS_expanded_special_forces:0 "Expanded Special Forces"
 ARS_expanded_special_forces_desc:0 "Even though the State Guard is considered an elite force by many, there is room for even more specialized roles on the battlefield. Expanding this concept will allow our limited numbers of forces to have a greater impact."
 ARS_international_arms:0 "International Arms"
 ARS_international_arms_desc:0 "The world may have seen enough war for several lifetimes, but that doesn't mean its arsenals and private inventors have been lax in their development of new weaponry."
 ARS_pragmatic_tank_production:0 "Pragmatic Tank Production"
 ARS_pragmatic_tank_production_desc:0 "Our use of tanks in the Six-Year War was unorganized and an overall disappointment. Compounding this was relatively minor experience building that kind of machinery. The Ministry of the Army thinks the new "Assault Gun" concept can save us both time and money, as well as increasing our numbers of fielded machines."
 ARS_everything_a_patriot_needs:0 "Everything a Patriot Needs"
 ARS_everything_a_patriot_needs_desc:0 "Rearming our soldiers isn't as simple as the Soviets seem to think, merely handing them a rifle and some ammunition. Everything our soldiers could ever need will be stockpiled for them ahead of time."
 ARS_arstotzkan_blitzkrieg:0 "Arstotzkan Blitzkrieg"
 ARS_arstotzkan_blitzkrieg_desc:0 "The Germans have a facinating theory on the conduct of modern warfare, using both armor and speed to cripple the enemy. With our limited industry we need to maximize our ability to build and maintain a solid armored force with speed in mind."
 ARS_armored_flexibility:0 "Armored Flexibility"
 ARS_armored_flexibility_desc:0 "Combining firepower, protection, and mobility all at once may seem like a tall order for us at this time, but the lives of our soldiers are a sacrifice we certainly cannot afford."
 ARS_unstoppable_juggernaut:0 "Unstoppable Juggernaut"
 ARS_unstoppable_juggernaut_desc:0 "Breaking through enemy lines is not only about tactics and technology, but also about morale. Smashing through enemy defenses in truly colossal tanks with impunity will render them not unable to fight, but unwilling."
